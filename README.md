#  Tesla Stock Price Analysis & Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the stock prices of **Tesla Inc. (TSLA)** using historical data and a simple regression model. The main goal is to forecast the **next day's adjusted closing price** using a linear regression approach.

---

##  Project Overview

- Load and clean Tesla stock data  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Build a Linear Regression model  
- Evaluate performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- Visualize trends and prediction results

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Python** 
- **Pandas** – data handling  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning (Linear Regression)

---

## Key Results

- **Model**: Linear Regression  
- **Target**: Next day's `Adj Close` price  
- **RMSE**: ~24.94  
 Interpretation: On average, the predicted price differs from the actual price by about \$24.94. This suggests a baseline for improving with more complex models or features.

## Future Work

- Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM)  
- Use technical indicators (Moving Averages, RSI, MACD)  
- Explore time series forecasting methods (ARIMA, Prophet)  
- Deploy as a Flask or Streamlit app for live predictions
